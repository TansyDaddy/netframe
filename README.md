A client-server flow goes something like: 
query from database -> (load from server -> save ->) display -> edit -> update.
With netframe, the flow above is all automatically set with very simple code, with no need to parse from JSON, display with views. You just need to specify fields with view ids, all the datas will be automatically displayed.

Netframe now supports TextView, ImageView, CheckBox and AbsListView.
