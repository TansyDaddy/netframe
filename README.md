Netframe is a framework for Android for developers to build C-S applications more efficiently. With netframe, developers will be able to easily access to database, network, images and diaplay them to your UI.
A common client-server flow goes something like: 
query from database -> (load from server -> save ->) display -> edit -> update.
With netframe, the flow above is all automatically set with very simple code.
